    <h1>HTML Recap</h1>
    <p> HTML is the main language for structuring webpages. It allows us to use tags to give our content properties,
        which will be rendered by a browser</p>
    <p> HTML relies on elements to work - these elements are like the keywords that browsers recognise to know what
        properties to apply to what. It's typically written as:<br>
        &lt;tagname &gt; The content &lt;/tagname &gt;</p>
    <p>The first block is the opening tag - it tells the browser "from this point on, render the contents with these
        properties." Then you have the content you want to use, and then you close the element with the closing tag.
        This tells the browser to stop rendering content with those properties. <br>
        The properties are defined by the tagname. These are all standard names that already exist, as many browsers
        need to be able to read them and know what to do. </p>
    <h2> Examples of HTML Tags</h2>
    <p> The &lt;p &gt; paragraph element &lt;/p &gt; <br>
        This is used to denote paragraphs or blocks of text. The browser renders a paragraph with some space above and
        below</p>
    <p> The &lt;h1 &gt; heading tag(s) &lt;/h1 &gt; <br>
        There are six heading tags in HTML. These are h1 - h6, and the are like newspaper headlines. H1 is the most
        important heading - and so should only be used once per page. </p>
    <p> The &lt;a &gt; anchor tag &lt;/a &gt; <br>
        The anchor tag is used to achor points - or create hyperlinks. These links can be internal, external, or
        jumplinks, links which allow us to link to a point on a page referenced by an ID.</p>
    <p> The &lt;img &gt; image tag<br>
        The image tag is used to embed images on a page. It is a standalone or self-closing tag, it doesn't need us to
        write in a closing tag. The img tag alone does very little - it needs an attribute to work. The attribute is
        <i>src</i> short for source - where is the image that you want to show located?<br>
        Another attribute for the img tag is <i>alt</i> short for alternative. It provides an alternative thing to
        display should the image not be rendered for any reason. It is especially useful for screen readers and
        accessibilty.
    </p>
    <h2>Groupings</h2>
    <p> We might want to group certain elements together into a box. Certain boxes exist for different reasons.
        Visually, the following tags would all look the same with no CSS, but a browser would be able to under the roles
        of boxes, their structure and the importance of them.</p>
    <h4>Blocks - elements which would not sit next to other content</h4>
    <p> The &lt;nav &gt; nav block &lt;/nav &gt; <br>
        The nav block is used to group together main navigation links</p>
    <p> The &lt;header &gt; header block &lt;/header &gt; <br>
        The header block is used to group together header information - maybe a logo or hero image, your website menu,
        your H1 element</p>
    <p> The &lt;footer &gt; footer block &lt;/footer &gt; <br>
        The footer block is used to group together information which sits at the foot of a page - though there is
        nothing in the HTML which forces it to the bottom! It would typically group things like contact info, copyright
        info, sitemaps etc</p>
    <p> The &lt;div &gt; div block &lt;/div &gt; <br>
        The div block is used when no other block is relevant. Check w3 schools for a list of all the elements that
        exist - there's a lot of them!</p>
    <h4>Inlines - elements which would not sit next to other content</h4>
    <p> The &lt;em &gt; em tag &lt;/em &gt; <br>
        Defines something as emphasised. A browser will show it as italic, and a screen reader will read it !</p>
    <p> The &lt;strong &gt; strong &lt;/strong &gt; <br>
       Defines text as strong. It has a high importance and browsers will render it bold</p>
    <p> The &lt;span &gt; span tag &lt;/span &gt; <br>
        Span is the inline version of div! When no other inline class is relevant, use span!</p>
